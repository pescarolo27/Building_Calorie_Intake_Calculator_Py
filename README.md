# Building a Calorie Intake Calculator

**Background:** As a Software Engineer in a Health and Leisure company, your task is to add a new feature to the app: a calorie and nutrition calculator. This tool will calculate and display total calories, sugars, fats, and other nutritional values for different foods based on user input.

You have been provided with the `nutrition.json` dataset, which contains the necessary nutritional information for various foods. Each value in the dataset is per **100 grams** of the food item. The dataset has already been read and loaded for you as the dictionary `nutrition_dict`.

**Purpose:** Enhance the Diet Coach app by creating the `nutritional_summary()` function to calculate and return the total nutritional values from the `nutrition_dict` dataset.
